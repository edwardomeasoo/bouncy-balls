# Bouncy Ball Display in Window
Practice for object theory and syntax details.
Using the [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Drawing_graphics) API and [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) API, write a bouncing balls demo.
The balls will bounce around the screen, and change colour when they touch each other.
